# Part One - Introduction

When I first started thinking about this project, I quickly had a vision of exaxtly what I wanted to do with it: find the best soup. 

I had many reasons for choosing this topic:

* I eat soups every day at the dining hall, but will soon be moving out of the dorm.
* I want to save on food expenses next year by cooking my own food.
* Many of my friends suprisingly do not like soups, so I'd like to perform some outreach on behalf of the Soup community.
